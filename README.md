I was selected as a member of Top-notch Postgraduate Innovative Talents Training "Yinhang Project" (研究生拔尖创新人才培养“引航计划”) of NUAA in 2022. 

I will join Assoc Prof [Chau Yuen](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02157)'s group in the [School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Jan 2024 
as a visiting Ph.D. student supported by Chinese Government Scholarship from China Scholarship Council (**CSC**).

I have just received a Master of Engineering degree from [Nanchang University](http://www.ncu.edu.cn), 
majoring in Electrical and Communication Engineering. 
Before that, I received a B.S. degree in Internet of Things Engineering from [Nanchang University](http://www.ncu.edu.cn) in 2017. 

Until now, I have published over 15 papers (citation: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@gs%2Fcitation.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations" class="linimage"/></a>, H index: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@gs%2Fh.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=H-index" class="linimage"/></a>), including *{{<font color="red">one ESI highly cited paper</font>}}*.
