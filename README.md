I am now a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Prof. Fuhui Zhou 
in [http://ceie.nuaa.edu.cn/ College of Electronic and Information Engineering], 
[http://www.nuaa.edu.cn Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics]. 
I was selected as a member of *Top-notch Postgraduate Innovative Talents Training "Yinhang Project" (研究生拔尖创新人才培养“引航计划”)* in 2022. 
I have just received a Master of Engineering degree from [http://www.ncu.edu.cn Nanchang University], 
majoring in Electrical and Communication Engineering. 
Before that, I received a B.S. degree in Internet of Things Engineering from [http://www.ncu.edu.cn Nanchang University] in 2017. 
Until now, I have published over 10 paper (citation: {{<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@main%2Fgs%2Fcitation.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations" height="18px"/></a>}}, H index: {{<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@main%2Fgs%2Fh.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=H-index" height="18px"/></a>}}), including *{{<font color="red">one ESI highly cited paper</font>}}*.

*My homepage is both hosted in server [https://haozhangcn.com] and Github [https://haozhangcn.github.io]*

{{<a href="cn_index.html">[中文简介]</a>}}

我目前是[http://www.nuaa.edu.cn 南京航空航天大学] [http://ceie.nuaa.edu.cn/ 电子信息工程学院] 的博士研究生，指导老师为周福辉教授。
我于2022年入选南京航空航天大学*研究生拔尖创新人才培养“引航计划”*。
我分别于2017年和2020年在[http://www.ncu.edu.cn 南昌大学]获得物联网工程专业学士学位和电子与通信工程硕士学位。
到目前为止，我已发表论文10余篇（引用：{{<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@main%2Fgs%2Fcitation.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations" height="18px"/></a>}}，H指数：{{<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@main%2Fgs%2Fh.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=H-index" height="18px"/></a>}}），其中包括*{{<font color="red">一篇ESI高被引论文</font>}}*。
