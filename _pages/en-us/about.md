**Assistant Researcher & Postdoctoral Fellow** @ [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nuaa.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn)<br>
No.29, Jiangjun Avenue, Jiangning District, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 211106<br>

Dr. Zhang received his Ph.D. degree from the [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn) in June 2025. 
he was a visiting Ph.D. student under the supervision of Associate Professor Chau Yuen (IEEE Fellow) at the [School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). 
Prior to that, he obtained his Master of Engineering degree and Bachelor's degree from [Nanchang University](http://www.ncu.edu.cn) in 2020 and 2017, respectively. 
He has long been engaged in research on electromagnetic signal intelligent processing theory and methods, and has published more than 30 papers in authoritative international communication journals or conferences such as IEEE COMST, IEEE JSAC, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TCOM, and IEEE TCCN (citations: [![GoogleCitations](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/haozhangcn/haozhangcn.github.io@gs/citation.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ), H index: [![hindex](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhaozhangcn%2Fhaozhangcn.github.io@gs%2Fh.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=H-index)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zs9DkEAAAAAJ) ), including `one ESI highly cited paper`.
He was awarded **Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award of China Electronics Education Society (CESE)** in 2025, and he was selected as a member of NUAA's Top-notch Postgraduate Innovative Talents Training "Yinhang Project" (南京航空航天大学研究生拔尖创新人才培养"引航计划"). 
He has served as a reviewer for IEEE JSAC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TCOM, IEEE WCM in the field of communications, and IEEE TNNLS, IEEE JSTARS, IEEE GRSM, IEEE CIM, ACM MM and other journal conferences in the field of artificial intelligence; he has served as a TPC member of IEEE ICC, IEEE CITIC and other international conferences.


## Research Interests
- **Electromagnetic signal intelligent processing** aims to apply machine learning and deep learning for a multitude of tasks in wireless communications, such as signal classification, spectrum sensing and signal identification and cognitive radio.
- **Foundation models**, also known as large AI model, are AI models designed to produce a wide and general variety of outputs. We are focusing on the application of foundation models in wireless communications and geoscience.
